# TrafficLights
This was the final project for my Assembly Language Programming class. The purpose of this project was to design Traffic Lights for two directions North to South and East to West.
I programmed this project to have two kinds of timers that dictate the timers of each light in a sequence and have various timings depending on the part of the day to incorporate rush hour time delays in order to make it more realistic.
